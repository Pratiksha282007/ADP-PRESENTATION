      <h2>Welcome to Chemistry</h2>
      <p>
        Chemistry is the study of matter ‚Äî its properties, composition, and how it interacts with energy and other substances. 
        This section covers key topics such as Hard and Soft Water, and E-Waste Management ‚Äî essential concepts in applied science and environmental studies.

      <h2>Chapter 1: Hard Water and Soft Water</h2>
      <p>
        Hard water is water that contains high concentrations of minerals, mainly calcium (Ca¬≤‚Å∫) and magnesium (Mg¬≤‚Å∫) ions. 
        Soft water, in contrast, has low levels of these minerals. The presence of these ions affects how water interacts with soap and industrial systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Causes of Hardness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When water passes through rocks like limestone or chalk, calcium and magnesium salts dissolve into it.</li>
        <li>These dissolved ions make the water ‚Äúhard‚Äù.</li>
        <li>Rainwater is naturally soft, but it can become hard as it flows through mineral-rich ground.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Types of Hardness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Temporary Hardness:</strong> Caused by bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium (e.g., Ca(HCO‚ÇÉ)‚ÇÇ and Mg(HCO‚ÇÉ)‚ÇÇ). It can be removed by boiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Hardness:</strong> Caused by sulfates or chlorides of calcium and magnesium (e.g., CaSO‚ÇÑ, MgCl‚ÇÇ). It cannot be removed by boiling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Removal of Hardness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boiling Method:</strong> Removes temporary hardness by precipitating calcium carbonate.</li>
        <li><strong>Lime-Soda Process:</strong> Adds lime and soda to precipitate calcium and magnesium as insoluble salts.</li>
        <li><strong>Ion Exchange Method:</strong> Uses resin beads to replace calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions, producing soft water.</li>
        <li><strong>Zeolite Process:</strong> Uses natural or synthetic zeolite to exchange sodium ions for calcium and magnesium.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Effects of Hard Water</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Forms scum instead of lather with soap, wasting detergent.</li>
        <li>Causes scaling in boilers, pipes, and kettles, reducing efficiency.</li>
        <li>Leads to rough fabrics and stains on utensils and bathroom fittings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages of Hard Water</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Contains essential minerals beneficial for human health in small amounts.</li>
        <li>Gives a better taste to drinking water in moderate hardness levels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Hard water and soft water differ mainly in mineral content. While soft water is preferred for domestic and industrial use, 
        moderate hardness is sometimes beneficial for health. Understanding water hardness helps manage resources efficiently and prevent equipment damage.

      <h2>Chapter 2: E-Waste Management</h2>
      <p>
        E-waste (electronic waste) refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices such as computers, mobile phones, televisions, and batteries. 
        It contains valuable materials like gold, copper, and silver, but also harmful substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium.
      </p>

      <h3>Sources of E-Waste</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Obsolete computers, laptops, and mobile phones.</li>
        <li>Old televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines.</li>
        <li>Used batteries, printers, and electronic accessories.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problems Caused by Improper E-Waste Disposal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Release of toxic metals into soil and groundwater.</li>
        <li>Air pollution from burning electronic parts.</li>
        <li>Health issues like respiratory problems and skin diseases.</li>
        <li>Loss of valuable and rare earth metals due to unscientific disposal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>E-Waste Management Methods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> Avoid unnecessary purchases and extend the life of electronic devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse:</strong> Donate or sell functioning devices instead of discarding them.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle:</strong> Recover useful materials such as metals and plastics through proper recycling facilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Refurbish:</strong> Repair and upgrade old devices for reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Disposal:</strong> Dispose e-waste through authorized collection centers and certified recyclers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Government Rules and Initiatives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of E-Waste Management Rules (India, 2016) to control and recycle electronic waste responsibly.</li>
        <li>Producer Responsibility: Manufacturers must take back used products for recycling.</li>
        <li>Awareness campaigns for safe disposal and recycling of e-waste.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Proper e-waste management ensures environmental protection, resource recovery, and public health safety. 
        By following the 3Rs ‚Äî Reduce, Reuse, Recycle ‚Äî and supporting recycling initiatives, we can make technology sustainable for the future.
